Insertion Sort
=======================

## Description

- INSERTION SORT is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
- It's worse case algorithmic time complexity is QUADRATIC or O(n^2).
- Stable: YES
