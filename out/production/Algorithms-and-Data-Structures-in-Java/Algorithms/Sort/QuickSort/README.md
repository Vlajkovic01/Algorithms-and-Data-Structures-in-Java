Quick Sort
=======================

## Description

- Like [MergeSort](../MergeSort), QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. 
- Quick sort exhibits its worst cast complexity - O(n^2) in this case. More precisely, Quick sort's worst case complexity of O(n^2) is observed when the input to be sorted is in decreasing order or increasing order (if the first elemnet is the pivot element).
- Stable: NO
